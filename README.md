### Deploying to azure from vscode
There is a free deployment at [maptial@azure](https://maptial.azurewebsites.net/).  
This is not satisfactory but it is better than nothing.  
The free hosting for python apps is very bad and most things areimpossible to do.  
This applicaiton os pretty intensive for both data size, data download, and calculations.  

To deploy with the vscode azure extenstion, when logged in, just rightclick on the maptial 
web app and select "deploy".
